            <p><span class="highlight">Owners of high-quality clothing</span> that no longer suits them may <span
                    class="highlight">hesitate to sell
                    secondhand due to low
                    prices
                    and a complicated selling process</span>. Nowadays, <span class="highlight">buyers are becoming more
                    accepting of secondhand
                    clothing</span>
                but
                are <span class="highlight">wary of unclear or inaccurate descriptions</span>. Online marketplaces that
                prioritize transparency and
                quality
                can benefit both buyers and sellers, promoting sustainable consumption.</p>

        <div class="intro_area">
            <h3 class="intro_title">Goal</h3>
            <p>The goal is that existing <span class="highlight">secondhand clothing can be reactivated in the market,
                    achieving infinite life
                    and
                    value through circular reuse.</span>
                <br><br>
                - Buyers can <span class="highlight">purchase high-quality clothing at lower prices than the original
                    retail price</span>. By buying
                unique
                and distinctive clothing, they can showcase their personal style.
                <br><br>
                - Sellers can <span class="highlight">solve the problem of accumulated clothing at home</span> and
                provide sufficient incentives for
                them
                to
                be willing to sell their clothing.

            <p><span class="highlight">Sustainable fashion has always been a significant issue in society</span>,
                especially with the recent promotion
                of SDGs in recent years. In the clothing market, <span class="highlight">the issue of clothing waste
                    caused by fast fashion's
                    "wear and discard"</span> mentality has been a pressing issue.
                <br><br>However, <span class="highlight">due to the enormous market
                    size of fast
                    fashion</span>, it's <span class="highlight">difficult to solve the problem from the root</span>.
                Therefore, we has decided to <span class="highlight">focus on
                    the secondhand apparel market</span>, partly because consumers are gradually accepting secondhand
                clothing and
                partly because we want to realize the value of clothing reuse.
                <br><br>To understand the potential user
                perspective and outlook of the secondhand clothing market, we conducted 11 user interviews and 1 expert
                interview.

            <h4>1.1 Expert Interview</h4>
            <p>During one of the expert interviews, we <span class="highlight">spoke with the CEO of a secondhand

                    insight into his observations and forecasts for the market</span>. We received two conclusions.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">- First,</span>
                <span class="highlight">secondhand markets are widely accepted in foreign countries</span>, and there

                    market</span>, the CEO observed that although
                the
                acceptance of secondhand
                clothing in Taiwan is not as high as in other countries, there is <span class="highlight">still a

            <h4>1.2 User Interview</h4>
            <p> During the user interview process, we conducted two phases of recruitment.In the
                first phase
                ,
                we
                focused on fast fashion, sustainable fashion, and secondhand clothing
                acceptance, and recruited six
                participants for interviews. In the second phase, we recruited five
                participants who had actual
                experience purchasing secondhand clothing for interviews.
                In order to <span class="highlight">obtain a comprehensive understanding of the interview data</span>,
                we <span class="highlight">conducted a two-step analysis
                    process.</span> <span class="highlight">Firstly, we organized the opinions and purchasing habits of
                    interviewees regarding secondhand
                    clothing</span> and have the following 4 key conclusions:
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> Secondhand clothing <span class="highlight">with low quality
                    and low price is generally perceived to
                    have inferior quality
                    and
                    may contain more defects</span>, making it less desirable than purchasing new clothing.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">- </span><span class="highlight">Low-quality and low-priced secondhand
                    clothing</span> typically has a more
                mainstream style, which <span class="highlight">fails to
                    highlight individual characteristics</span>.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> <span class="highlight">Expensive clothing that is rarely worn
                    is not typically purchased as
                    new.</span><br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> Individuals are <span class="highlight">more likely to
                    consider purchasing secondhand clothing that
                    offers high quality,
                    falls within the mid-to-high price range, and is priced lower than new clothing</span>.<br><br>
                In the second step, we <span class="highlight">converged the research data into 3 potential user
                    personas</span>, which would

                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> <span class="highlight">All platforms covered the high-end

                low-end clothing market.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Based on the multitude of categories and price ranges in the secondhand
                clothing market, we needed to determine our target market and identify areas with high demand and
                potential. After synthesizing the results of expert interviews, two phases of user interviews, and
                competitor analysis, we concluded that <span class="highlight">low-priced secondhand clothing brands
                    generally have lower
                    quality and prices</span>, resulting in consumers preferring to buy new clothes directly.

            <p style="margin-bottom: -16px;">After defining the core product services, we aims to design an app that

                Wireflow based on the app's functions.

            <h4>Why App ?</h4>
            <p>There are 3 reasons why we prefers an app over a website:
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> In today's era, <span class="highlight">almost everyone has a

                anytime and anywhere.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> Mobile phones record various aspects of our lives, making
                them
                feel <span class="highlight">more private and personal to us
                    than
                    a website</span>.<br><br>

            <p style="margin-bottom: -72px;">Recruiting 6 participants for usability testing with a lo-fi prototype, we
                aimed to answer 5 research questions:

                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> Is the process of buying secondhand clothes smooth to

                to operate?<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> Can users easily track their purchase history?<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 900;">-</span> Is the process of donating or recycling clothes smooth to

                    considered

                        <p>In previous version, users had to click on a logo icon at the bottom of the screen to make a
                            reservation for our services. However, usability testing showed that <span

                            function. To
                            address this issue, we <span class="highlight">moved the service reservation function to the

                            making it more intuitive and accessible for users.

                        <p>During the usability testing, participants found that the terms <span class="highlight">"My

                                and "Purchase History" were too similar in their noun definitions</span>, which caused
                            confusion
                            for some users. Therefore, our team <span class="highlight">renamed "My Products" to "My

                            products that the user has listed for sale. Additionally, we <span

            <p style="margin-bottom: -72px;"> This was my first time leading a team through a UX project, which gave me
                a
                deeper understanding and familiarity with the UX process. Looking back on the competition, from choosing
                the topic to the final result, we were constantly challenged by ourselves, mentor or the judges, and the
                plan
                was changed and improved multiple times. But I think this is the most valuable part of the competition,
                as we were not afraid to make mistakes and tried our best to learn from them through a process of trial
                and error.
                <br><br>I am very grateful for the hard work of each team member during this period, as they spent a
                lot of time brainstorming and contributing ideas despite their academic workload. I also want to express
                my appreciation to our mentors who helped guide us back on track whenever we encountered difficulties,
                enabling us to achieve our final results.
