            <h3 class="intro_title">Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>We conducted usability testing with 4 targeted users on the first version and have the following
                3 key conclusions:
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">1. Complex information architecture and lengthy information retrieval
                    process:</span><br>
                - <span class="highlight">Unclear category titles</span> that make it <span class="highlight">difficult
                    for users to determine where
                    their desired information
                    is located.</span><br>
                - <span class="highlight">Information related to the school's research areas</span>, which users
                generally consider important,
                <span class="highlight">requires
                    multiple steps to access.</span><br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">2. Website interaction design not aligned with user
                    habits:</span><br>
                - <span class="highlight">Significant differences compared to typical informational websites</span>,
                resulting in a learning curve
                for
                users to adapt to the new interaction design.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">3. Content presentation decrease browsing motivation:</span><br>
                - Information related to the school's research areas <span class="highlight">requires additional file
                    downloads</span>.<br>
                - <span class="highlight">Content appears disorganized and lengthy</span>, reducing browsing motivation.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro_area">
            <h3 class="intro_title">Goal</h3>
            <p>The team's overall goal is to <span class="highlight">enhance the website's browsing experience and
                    traffic</span>, including:<br><br>
                - <span class="highlight">Restructuring the website's information architecture</span> for more efficient
                information retrieval.<br><br>
                - <span class="highlight">Aligning interactive elements with standard conventions</span> to reduce user
                learning costs.
                <br><br>
                - <span class="highlight">Improving content richness and readability</span> by optimizing formatting and
                presentation.

                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Content Transition:</span> The school's preference to <span

                    original content from the first version </span>of
                the website without modifications poses a challenge in transitioning to the new version.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Content Writing:</span> <span class="highlight"> Varying levels of
                    information provided by
                    different laboratories</span> make it <span class="highlight">challenging
                    to ensure consistent and high-quality content writing</span> across the website.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Cost Control:</span><span class="highlight"> Managing the extensive
                    amount of data</span> on the
                website and <span class="highlight">presenting it in a clear and

            <p style="margin-top: 24px;">To ensure website usability, the team <span class="highlight">conducted
                    heuristic evaluations using
                    high-fidelity prototypes</span> based on Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics. We tested on iOS,
                Android,
                macOS,
                and Windows devices, primarily using Safari and Chrome browsers, for <span class="highlight">2 user

            <p style="margin-top: 48px;">
                Based on the test results, I have identified <span class="highlight">2 direction that need
                    optimization</span> based on severity of
                issues:
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">1. Consistency and standards:</span><br>
                - In the campus introduction section, there is <span class="highlight">inconsistency in the number of
                    displayed images before
                    and
                    after clicking</span>, with duplicate images present.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">2. Match between system and the real world:</span><br>
                - The <span class="highlight">absence of clickable links in the laboratory descriptions</span> for
                research directions, <span class="highlight">causing
                    confusion
                    for users.</span><br>
                - <span class="highlight">The "NYCU" title in the Navigation Bar</span>, which may <span
                    class="highlight">mislead users to
                    believe it will take them back
                    to
                    the
                    landing page</span>, but actually leads to the school introduction. This <span
                    class="highlight">naming confusion needs to
                    be
                    addressed.</span>
            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 72px;">Usability Testing</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:24px">After optimizing the website based on the issues identified in the heuristic
                evaluation, we <span class="highlight">conducted a second phase of testing</span> to <span
                    class="highlight">ensure that the
                    website
                    aligns with the usage

                    version</span>. For this second
                phase,
                we
                recruited 4 students and 4 alumni from the industry to conduct usability testing. Based on the test
                results, I have <span class="highlight">prioritized the identified issues into 3 levels:</span>
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- High priority:</span> Issues that <span class="highlight">severely
                    impact the usability</span> of the
                website.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Medium priority:</span> Issues <span class="highlight">related to
                    copywriting or placement of
                    UI elements.</span><br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Low priority:</span> Issues that <span class="highlight">don't
                    significantly affect website
                    usability or readability</span>, or are <span class="highlight">related
                    to copywriting but lack corresponding data.</span><br>
                <br><br>
                I <span class="highlight">focused on addressing the high and medium priority issues</span> as our top
                optimization goals, in order
                to improve the usability and user experience of the website.

            <div class="seperate_intro"></div>
            <p>During this project, which involved leading a team in developing a large-scale website, I was responsible
                for overseeing the design team's deliverables and closely collaborating with UI designers and front-end
                developers. This experience allowed me to grow in two key areas:<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">1.
                    Streamlining requirements for efficient team execution: </span>Filtering requirements for smoother
                team execution: With numerous
                stakeholders in the project, internal meetings often generated many new ideas. To ensure project
                progress while meeting stakeholders' needs, I developed a habit of filtering requirements during
                internal meetings. Starting with the project objectives, I prioritized requirements to ensure they
                aligned with the original project goals. Drawing on my experience in website development, I then
                approached the discussions from a technical feasibility and front-end perspective, persuading
                stakeholders when certain features were not feasible or would entail high development difficulty,
                potentially impacting the project timeline. This streamlined the discussion on feasibility and
                accelerated the development efficiency for front-end developers.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">2,
                    Managing the project required extensive and effective
                    communication: </span>Due to the tight timeline for design and development, planning the project
                progress was challenging. To address this, I first listed all the pages that needed to be designed, and
                then prioritized them based on urgency and importance of the page blocks. Before starting each design, I
                reviewed the page content with the other two team members in the design team to understand the
                complexity and richness of the content, and together we discussed and evaluated the level of difficulty
                and estimated workdays. Based on the discussion outcomes, we then finalized the project timeline.
