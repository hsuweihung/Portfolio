            <h3 class="intro_title">Summary</h3>
            <p>This project was collaborated with Yahoo App as part of an industry-academia partnership. Working closely
                with the UX Lead and Project Manager, our objective was to address specific business challenges and
                deliver a comprehensive research report. The project comprised two main phases: the exploration phase,
                where we aimed to understand the needs of the target market users to provide design feature
                recommendations, and the evaluation phase, which focused on assessing Yahoo App to identify existing
                design issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro_area">
            <h3 class="intro_title">Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Yahoo App is a Super App that provides a wide range of lifestyle services, with a
                strong focus on user growth. However, it faces a challenge in reaching the Gen Z (16-25 years old)
                demographic. To tap into this market, we conducted UX research to identify design opportunities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro_area">
            <h3 class="intro_title">Goal</h3>
            <p>As Gen Z is a crucial demographic for Yahoo App, we aimed to achieve the following from a user growth
                perspective:
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Understanding the news consumption habits of the Gen Z
                    generation</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Providing design recommendations that are appealing to Gen Z</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Identifying current usability issues in the Yahoo App user
                    experience</span>
                <br><br>
                Due to research constraints, our focus was primarily on exploring the news features.

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <img src="./image/Yahoo/research_process.png" style="margin-bottom:16px;" alt="">
            <div class="seperate_intro"></div>

        <div class="intro_area">
            <h3 class="intro_title">01 Interview</h3>
            <div class="seperate_intro"></div>
            <p style="margin-bottom:32px">In the Explore phase, our primary objective was to identify features that
                would be appealing to the Gen Z demographic and enhance their usage motivation. In the initial step, the
                team conducted in-depth interviews from a qualitative perspective with the target audience Yahoo App
                aimed to reach. We focused on gathering data related to news consumption behavior, motivations, needs,
                and pain points to serve as entry points for converting into design recommendations.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:32px">During this phase, a total of 11 formal interviews were conducted, with
                respondents aged between 21-25 years old. The interview data was analyzed using affinity diagrams to
                synthesize the research findings.</p>
            <img src="./image/Yahoo/Affinity.png" style="margin-bottom:24px;" alt="">
            <p style="margin-bottom:32px;margin-top:48px">The research findings can be roughly categorized into three
                stages: News Opportunity, News Assessment, and Further Investigation, which can be seen as the pre, mid,
                and post stages of information reception.</p>
            <img src="./image/Yahoo/interview_finding.png" style="margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:24px" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="intro_area">
            <h3 class="intro_title">02 Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <div class="seperate_intro"></div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">During the in-depth interviews, the team extracted research findings from
                the interview data. In this phase, we attempted to analyze products in the market that provide news
                services, systematically breaking down the features of various apps. The first step involved assessing
                whether these features could attract Gen Z users. We then used the research findings from the in-depth
                interviews as a foundation to consider whether Yahoo App could draw inspiration or offer
                differentiation.
                <br><br>
                In this stage, we primarily focused on apps with a rating of 4 stars or above and those available for
                free in the 'News' section of the App Store. We identified the top 50 products and deconstructed Yahoo
                App's information functions into six major categories: Home Feed, Category Pages, News Articles, Push
                Notifications, Search, and Advertising. Finally, the team evaluated whether these 50 products possessed
                these six features and examined their completeness. After a series of filters and assessments, we
                selected 10 products for further analysis, as shown in the chart below.
            </p>
            <img src="./image/Yahoo/Comparative analysis.png" class="table img.lazy" alt="">
            <p style="margin-top: 40px;margin-bottom: 40px">Integrating the results from in-depth interviews and
                competitive analysis, the team initially compiled recommendations for development in four key areas. To
                further refine these development recommendations and identify features that would be appealing to the
                Gen Z demographic, we planned to conduct a survey</p>
            <img src="./image/Yahoo/Design_Direction.png" style="margin-bottom:16px;" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="intro_area">
            <h3 class="intro_title">03 Survey</h3>
            <div class="seperate_intro"></div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">After the team had preliminary development recommendations, to further
                understand which among the many development suggestions would genuinely appeal to the Gen Z demographic
                and to investigate the impact of advertising on the platform's user experience, we planned to conduct a
                survey analysis. This analysis would be divided into three steps.
                <br><br>
                The first step involved using descriptive statistics to understand Gen Z's perceptions of advertising.
                Linear regression would be employed to analyze whether the frequency of news consumption in a news app
                is affected by advertising.
                <br><br>
                The second step aimed to explore which forms of advertising are more acceptable to the Gen Z
                demographic, considering not only a user-centric perspective but also a business perspective.
                <br><br>
                The final step would involve using the Kano Model to gauge the attractiveness level of each feature.

        <div class="intro_area_sub intro_area">
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: -40px;">GenZ & Advertisement</h4>
            <div class="outcome_area_a reverse">
                <div><img src="./image/Yahoo/ad_annoying.png" alt=""></div>
                <div class="reverse_text">
                    <p>Descriptive statistics reveal that most Gen Z individuals, who generally consume news, find news
                        page advertising bothersome (N=253), as shown in the graph (vertical axis representing bother
                        percentage, horizontal axis representing news consumption frequency).
                        <br><br>
                        However, when using linear regression to examine if news consumption frequency is influenced by
                        advertising, the effect doesn't reach significance (p value > .05). Hence, users aren't
                        disrupted by advertising when consuming news.
                        <br><br>
                        While the regression analysis indicates no impact on news consumption frequency by advertising
                        in the Gen Z demographic, descriptive statistics still show that the majority of Gen Z
                        individuals find advertising very bothersome. Therefore, the team believes that, from both
                        Yahoo's perspective and statistical analysis, advertising can still be retained in the Yahoo
                        App. The next step is to explore how to optimize the advertising experience by reducing
                        interference."

                <div class="reverse_text">
                    <p>In the previous phase, we learned that even though advertising does not impact the frequency of
                        Gen Z usage in news apps, it is still a bother to them. Therefore, in this phase, we aimed to
                        explore which forms of advertising are more acceptable to Gen Z. The team tested five
                        advertising formats: Pop-up, Interstitial, Native, Banner, and Full-screen. The results
                        indicated that Native and Banner ads are more acceptable to Gen Z.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:32px">After understanding the impact of advertising on the platform experience,
                    the third step involved using the Kano Model to explore the priority of development recommendations
                    from the eight (conclusions integrated from in-depth interviews and competitive analysis) based on
                    their attractiveness to the Gen Z demographic. In prioritizing development features, the Kano
                    Model's 'Must-Have' is considered the highest priority level, followed by 'One-Dimensional.'
                    'Indifferent' is not considered at this stage.
                    <br><br>
                    The top-priority features, consisting of both Must-Have and One-Dimensional, include:
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: 800;">- Must-Have:</span> Quick temporary storage for news articles to

            <div class="seperate_intro"></div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">In the Evaluate phase, the goal was to identify design issues within the
                current Yahoo App. The team initially conducted an internal assessment of the product based on Jakob
                Nielsen's ten design heuristics, aimed at uncovering more detailed design problems within Yahoo App. In
                this phase, the team defined three heuristic evaluation tasks: 'Focusing on Specific Content,' 'Browsing
                News,' and 'Observing and Expressing Ideas.' Following the internal assessment, the team identified five
                design issues primarily related to the 'Focusing on Specific Content' and 'Browsing News' tasks.

            <div class="seperate_intro"></div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: -16px;">To comprehensively explore the design issues existing in Yahoo App, the
                team conducted usability testing to assess the product from a user perspective. Additionally, they used
                the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) to gauge user satisfaction. In the
                usability testing phase, the team designed five common tasks that users often perform in Yahoo App. They
                recruited a total of five participants, all from the Gen Z demographic, who regularly consume news
                through news apps but had not previously used Yahoo App. Among the five tasks, the team identified a
                total of 10 design issues across 4 categories, and provided corresponding design recommendations.
